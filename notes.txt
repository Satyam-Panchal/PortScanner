what do we need to do to scan any port
1. establish the connection with the system
    here we use socket library, socket library allows us to establish a connection over the internet.

    fisrt we define a socket descripter by 
        sock = socket.socket()
        
    now to connect to the target ip we will call function
        sock.connect((ipaddress, port))

        here ipaddress and port variables are already declared and given values. 

        we put this in try catch block so that if the connectionis not established we can print port is closed.
    
    so now if the url is given in the ipaddress variable it will show that the port is closed.
    we can find the ip of url by nslookup in teminal

    we also add sock.settimeout(0.5) so that one port is only scanned for a particular interval of time

2. now we will try to get ip address from the domain name
    function named IP() in library IPy is used for this purpose.

    if in the function IP() we provide any ip address it will do nothing that means it simply returns the ip address.

    but is IP() is provided with any domain name it will give a ValueError.

    so we will try IP(ip) for ValueError if there is any error then we will do
        socket.gethostbyname(ip)
    this function will convert the domain name into ip adrres andthen return it.

3. now we want that our programm can accept multiple targets

4. now we will find the services running on the  open ports by grabbing thr banner.
    we need to connect to port and than recieve the information from the port and then read that information.

    s.recv(bytes) this function recieve the information on the port
    but this information is encoded so we need to decode the information by
        banner.decode().strip('\n')
        here strip('\n') will strip any unwanted \n\r etc
